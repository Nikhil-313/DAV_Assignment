# 🏡 Housing Data Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Visualization** of a housing dataset. It aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to house prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, air conditioning, and more.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze and visualize the housing dataset to:
- Understand key factors affecting house prices
- Explore the relationships between multiple house features
- Generate pivot tables and insightful visual graphs
- Prepare the data for potential machine learning applications

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Operations Performed

- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Descriptive Statistics and Summary
- Encoding Categorical Variables
- Correlation Analysis
- Pivot Tables
- Graphical Visualizations:
  - Bar plots
  - Box plots
  - Heatmaps
  - Pairplots
  - Count plots
  - Regression plots
  - Violin plots

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains housing details like:
- Area (in sq. ft.)
- Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms
- Furnishing Status
- Air Conditioning Availability
- Preferred Area Indicator
- Price (Target Variable)

> 📍 Dataset: `Housing.csv`

## 📈 Key Insights

- House prices are strongly correlated with area and furnishing status.
- Preferred locations tend to have higher prices.
- Visuals revealed clear trends based on number of bedrooms and air conditioning.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Apply regression models to predict house prices.
- Perform feature engineering to enhance predictive capabilities.
- Build an interactive dashboard using Plotly or Streamlit.

## 📎 How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Upload `Housing.csv` when prompted
4. Run all cells to explore the analysis
